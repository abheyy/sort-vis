Bubble sort is a simple and straightforward sorting algorithm. However, it is not commonly used in real-life implementations due to its slow performance compared to other more efficient algorithms. Its time complexity is O(n^2), making it inefficient for large datasets.
One example of where bubble sort could be used in real life is when sorting a small list of items in an application or program where performance is not a significant concern. For instance, if you had a list of only 10 items, bubble sort could be an appropriate algorithm to use since it would still sort the list relatively quickly.
However, in general, more efficient sorting algorithms such as quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort are used in real-life implementations where performance is critical, especially for large datasets.`;

        Bubble Sort
      </a>{' '}
      is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the
      list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the
      wrong order.The pass through the list is repeated until the list
      is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for
      the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the
      list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and
      impractical for most problems
